# Coffee-Sales
TASK
It’s your first week at Plateaux Vintners, and you’ve been tasked with a critical project. Mr. Ajoy, the CEO, has received conflicting reports about the coffee market in the NCR region. Some reports indicate that the market is saturated, while others highlight significant untapped potential. To clarify the market opportunity, you need to provide a comprehensive analysis. 

Your goal is to deliver a clear and actionable picture of the market potential, helping Mr. Ajoy make an informed decision on whether to proceed with the new coffee house venture.

KEY INSIGTHS

1) Sales remains steady from January to June but declines by July for all locations, suggesting less demand  during this period.

2) Location1 peak hours for sales is 1pm & 8pm, Location2 peak hours for sales is 2pm & 6pm, Location3 peak hours for sales are 11am & 7pm, suggesting heavy commuter traffic and office crowd potential. A new outlet near business districts or transport hubs could perform well.

3) Customers favor Cocoa & Cappuccino flavors in all 3 locations, but for location3 they favor Latte, location2 also favor Hot-chocolate 

4) More cash payments but the growing preference for digital payment in Location1&2 indicates tech-savvy customers; integrating loyalty programs or mobile apps can boost retention.

5) Mondays & Thursdays seem to be the days all 3 locations make the most revenue
